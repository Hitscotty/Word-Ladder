# Code-To-Work: Word Ladder

The game gives the players two starting words of the same length (gain and fire in this example) and a number of blank spaces in between. The objective of the game is to fill each blank space with a word that differs from the word above and the word below it by a single letter. For example, one solution (there may be several) to the above puzzle is:

+ **gain**
+ gait
+ wait
+ wart
+ ware
+ wire
+ **fire**
